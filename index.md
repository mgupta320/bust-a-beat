# The Bust-A-Beat Soundboard
## About
The Bust-A-Beat Soundboard is an intuitive soundboard that can be used to create, play, and save simple songs made using an mBED LPC1768 development board for computing along with several other parts used for tasks from song display, saving/loading music, and, most importantly, playing some tunes.

This website documents the hardware and software used to create this project so that you might be able to make your own Bust-A-Beat.
